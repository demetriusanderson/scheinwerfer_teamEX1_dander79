A young boy named Michael was walking on Hauptstrasse, in Germany, when he heard a crash.
He jumped out of his BMW and ran passed the Baeckerei. 
There was a hund, frightened, running the opposite direction as he ran.
He decided to chase it, running as fast as his lederhose would let him.
After a wettbewerbsfaehig chase he finally caught up to the hund.
